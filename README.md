A regular expression (also calledÂ **regex**Â orÂ **regexp**) is a way to describe a pattern. It is used to locate or validate specific strings or patterns of text in a sentence, document, or any other character input.

Writing regular expressions is a skill of itself & I use them in my work all the time, so this becomes time consuming.

This project aims to use OpenAI's API to automatically generate regular expressions based on your prompt.

This project was made using [ReTool](https://retool.com/), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/overview) & [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/).
