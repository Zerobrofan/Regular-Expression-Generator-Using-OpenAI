  This project aims to use OpenAI's API to automatically generate regular expressions based on your prompt.

## About
A regular expression (also calledÂ **regex**Â orÂ **regexp**) is a way to describe a pattern. It is used to locate or validate specific strings or patterns of text in a sentence, document, or any other character input.

Writing regular expressions is a skill of itself & I use them in my work all the time, so this becomes time consuming.

This project was made using [ReTool](https://retool.com/), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/overview) & [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/).


- **Skills used: HTML - CSS - JavaScript - REST API** <br> <br>
:warning: **This project is currently down since OpenAI's subscription has expired.** I'll update the README.md when it's back online.
